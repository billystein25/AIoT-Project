# AIoT Course - Project 2 (Human Gesture Recognition Project)

**An End-to-end Artificial Intelligence of Things Project**

## About this Project

* A team of a max of **3 students** is mandatory for each project
* Announcement date: **20 April, 2026** 
* Delivery Date: **25 May, 2026, 23:59**
* Grade: **40%**

## Project Description

In this project, you are prompted to create an end-to-end Artificial 
Intelligence of Things (AIoT) procedure in order to recognize a set of gestures 
automatically. This problem is identified as Human Gesture Recognition (HGR), 
which is actually the technology that uses sensors to read and interpret hand 
gestures as commands. Nowadays, HGR has multiple uses in various domains, such 
as healthcare, industry, gaming, etc. In the automotive industry, for instance, 
this capability allows drivers and passengers to interact with the vehicle — 
usually to control the infotainment system without touching any buttons or 
screens.

In particular, you will take advantage of the Mbientlab’s sensorial device, 
MetaMotionR research sensor kit [1], and its wristband [2], which is a 
wrist-worn device that provides recorded (logging) or real-time (streaming) 
sensor data. The sensor kit embeds the Bosch BMI160 Inertial Measurement Unit 
(IMU), which is a small, low-power, low-noise 16-bit inertial measurement unit 
designed for use in mobile applications like augmented reality or indoor 
navigation, which require highly accurate, real-time sensor kinesiological 
data. In full operation mode, the user can enable both the accelerometer and 
gyroscope sensors to collect the movement data. The device, the wristband, and 
the embedded IMU are presented in Figure 1. 

For the data collection procedure, you can utilize the mobile and desktop 
open-source applications (MetaWear, MetaBase) that Mbientlab provides in the 
Apple Store (Mac, iPhone), the Play Store, and the Windows Store:

* [Mbientlab MetaWear and MetaBase Apps for iOS and macOS on App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/mbientlab-inc/id920878580)
* [Mbientlab MetaWear App on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mbientlab.metawear.app)
* [Mbientlab MetaBase App on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mbientlab.metawear.metabase)
* [Mbientlab MetaBase on Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/metabase/9NBLGGH4TXJ3)


As an alternative option, you can use the MetaWear APIs the company provides 
in Java, Swift, JavaScript, Python, and C++ programming languages:

(IMU).*

After collecting the data, you will proceed with data engineering and 
preparation methodologies in order to transform the data into a suitable 
format capable of training the AI models. Then, you will select between a set 
of supervised-learning Machine Learning models for the learning procedure, 
and finally you will evaluate the AI models with respect to their performance.

You will train the ML models in two ways:
1. by feeding the ML algorithms with segmented-windowed data
2. by generating a set of features (feature engineering), and then, feeding the
ML models

It is suggested to read the whole papers that are provided in the "References" 
section in order to better understand the identification scenario.

## Gesture Definition and Execution

**For the learning scenario, you will perform the activities described below:** 

*Using the smart wearable device, you will be recording standard smartphone 
gestures commonly used while navigating social media. Please follow these 
descriptions and guidelines carefully to ensure uniform data collection across 
all groups.*

You will collect data for five distinct gestures. Ensure the subject performs 
these as naturally as they would when browsing a social media feed 
(e.g., Instagram, TikTok, or X).

1. Scroll Up
   * Action: The user places their finger on the screen and drags it downward 
   to move the on-screen content up (revealing older or lower content). 
   * Requirement: Define and record whether the subject is using their thumb 
   or index finger.

2. Scroll Down 
   * Action: The user places their finger on the screen and drags it upward to 
   move the on-screen content down (revealing newer or higher content). 
   * Requirement: Define and record whether the subject is using their thumb or 
   index finger.

3. Swipe Left
   * Action: A horizontal swipe where the finger starts on the right side of 
   the screen and quickly glides to the left (commonly used to view the next 
   photo in a carousel or move to the next tab). 
   * Requirement: Define and record whether the subject is using their thumb 
   or index finger.

4. Swipe Right 
   * Action: A horizontal swipe where the finger starts on the left side of 
   the screen and quickly glides to the right (commonly used to go back a page 
   or view a previous photo). 
   * Requirement: Define and record whether the subject is using their thumb 
   or index finger.

5. Texting
   * Action: Typing a standard message on the smartphone's virtual keyboard. 
   * Requirement: The subject should type naturally and continuously (e.g., 
   copying a provided block of text or writing stream-of-consciousness) for 
   the recording intervals. Two-handed thumb typing or single-handed typing 
   is acceptable, but the typing style should ideally be noted in your project 
   log.


## Instructions for data collection and annotation

### Part 1: Requirements & Structure

Based on your gestures collection definition, please use the accelerometer 
and/or gyroscope.

1. You familiarize yourself with the wearable and select one or more of its sensors 
that indicate movement, i.e., accelerometer and/or gyroscope.
2. To properly collect the instances, you must be careful that the data contains 
exactly the instances of interest. This means that the recording of the data 
collection must start while you perform the gesture repetitively, and 
terminate the recording before you stop performing the gesture.
3. Time Requirements & Structure:
   * Time per Gesture: 5 minutes per subject. 
   * Total Time per Subject: 25 minutes (5 gestures × 5 minutes each). 
   * Total Time per Group: 1 hour and 15 minutes (75 minutes), assuming 3 
   subjects per group.
4. You collect and annotate the data based on the gesture classes you want to 
train the AI model. 
5. Visualize the sensor data in the following ways: 
   * Accelerometer data (3-axis).
   * Gyroscope data (3-axis).
   * Accelerometer and Gyroscope data (6-axis).

**Note: Collect a representative dataset, meaning each class should have 
almost the same time-length of instances in total.**

### Part 2: Recording Guidelines

To maintain data integrity, do not mix gestures in a single recording.

* Standalone Collection: Each recording must capture strictly one specific 
gesture at a time. 
* Repetitive Cycles: Break the 5-minute requirement into manageable, repetitive 
cycles. *Example: Record 20 seconds of continuous "Scrolling Up", stop the 
recording, take a brief pause, and repeat another 20-second recording until 
you have accumulated the required 5 minutes of data for that specific gesture.*
* Documentation: For scrolling and swiping, you must strictly define and log 
whether the subject is using their thumb (typical of one-handed use) or their 
index finger (typical of two-handed use). The subject should remain consistent 
with the chosen finger for the duration of that specific gesture's recording.

## Configuration

As the majority of software projects work with configuration files to set up 
the instantiation of their components or experiments, we follow the same 
principle in this project too.

Thus, we provide you with a configuration file as an indicator of how to set up
your project. This file should contain all the parameters set up that are 
utilized for the project. To use this file, please copy and rename the 
`config.yml.template`, which is located in the root directory, to `config.yml`.

Additionally, the file should comprise all parameters regarding the MongoDB 
host, the database name, the collection name, as well as parameters about the 
data engineering and the learning processes.

## Dataset creation

1. Follow the folder and files structure guideline, which can be found 
in `data/README.md`.
2. The data that is related to the gestures collection process before you upload 
it to the database will be stored inside the `data` folder.
3. Instantiate a `mongod` primary daemon process for the MongoDB system.
4. Based on the instructions in `aiot_dataset_creation_sample.ipynb`:
   * Create the database and the collection where you will save your data. 
   * Transform the data into the proper MongoDB document format. 
   * Upload the data to your collection.
* The sampling frequency (sampling rate) should be at 100Hz.

Note: Use the MongoDB Compass GUI to check your database and collections:

* https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass
    
## Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Processing

As it was described in the "Project Description" section, two different ML
solutions will be provided:
* feed the ML algorithms with segmented-windowed data. To help you with the 
process, you can study the publication [7] in the "References" section. 
* generate a set of features (feature engineering), and then feed the
ML models. Accordingly, you can study publication [4] as a guide.

Thus, you will create two different Jupyter Notebooks that correspond to each 
ML solution:

1. `aiot_project_time_series.ipynb`
2. `aiot_project_feature_engineering.ipynb`

Check, for example, the `aiot_project_sample.ipynb`.

### Data Exploration

For the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the Data Engineering process for 
both a single instance and the whole dataset, please follow the instructions 
below. In particular, according to this step, you are prompted to implement 
and run the following steps (the order is indicative):

* Provide a barplot that contains the time-length of the collected instances 
for each class.
* Time-series segmentation: Split the data into fixed windows of X seconds 
with X% overlap (in samples). 
* Provide a barplot with the count of instances that occurred after this 
process, for each class. 
* Filter the data with a low-pass filter at a frequency of *X* Hz.
* Visualize a time-series instance of the transformed dataset to see the 
effect of the filter on the signal. 
* Detect outliers and/or find missing values.

### Data Transformation

* Provide the input vector of the segmented windows.
* Provide the input vector after feature engineering. Which features are 
discriminative and useful for the model? 
* For the extracted feature set, determine which features to keep (feature selection).
* Perform dimensionality reduction (if needed) by using Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA).


### Data Preparation

1. Split the data into train and test sets. Two subjects from the team will 
compose the train set and one the test set.
2. Use a scaling algorithm to scale the data into a standard value range 
(for instance, Standardization, Min Max Normalization). Exploit Python's 
`scikit-learn` library.

## Learning Process (ML Modeling)

1. Select a supervised Machine Learning approach to perform the gesture 
recognition scenario, by exploiting Python's `scikit-learn` library. For 
instance, you can use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, Random Forests, 
or other models.
2. Fit the data into the model. 
3. Evaluate the ML model performance in the form of Confusion Matrix and 
Classification Report by using the evaluation metrics that arise from the 
True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, False Negatives 
classification results. 
4. Explore and understand the data adequately and provide your insights.
5. Fine-tune the ML model (e.g., use Exhaustive Grid Search algorithm). Exploit 
Python's `scikit-learn` library.
